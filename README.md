## üöÄ Overview

Slidev-AI is an enhanced web application that leverages LLM (Large Language Model) technology combined with a powerful local knowledge base to make creating Slidev-based online presentations elegant and effortless. Building upon the original slidev-ai project, this fork adds comprehensive knowledge management capabilities, allowing users to upload, organize, and leverage their own documents for intelligent presentation generation.

### üÜï Enhanced Features

This fork extends the original project with:

- **üìö Local Knowledge Base**: Upload and manage PDF, Markdown, Word documents, and text files
- **üîç Smart Document Processing**: Automatic content extraction, parsing, and vectorization
- **üß† Semantic Search**: AI-powered document search and retrieval
- **üéØ Knowledge-Driven Generation**: Create presentations based on your specific knowledge corpus
- **üîÑ Four-Stage Generation Flow**: Streamlined workflow from configuration to final presentation
- **üë• User Management**: Role-based access control for document and presentation management

> **Original Project**: This project is based on the excellent work by [LSTM-Kirigaya](https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya) for the [ModelScope MCP&Agent Competition](https://modelscope.cn/active/aihackathon-mcp-agent).

This enhanced version maintains compatibility with the [OpenMCP](https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-client) ecosystem while adding enterprise-ready knowledge management capabilities. This project serves as:

- A comprehensive knowledge-base-driven presentation platform
- A reference implementation for document-aware AI applications  
- A production-ready solution for organizations managing large knowledge repositories
- An extended template for creating domain-specific AI agents with document intelligence
