## Quick Start
### System Requirements
- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.10+
- npm 9+ or yarn 1.22+
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended for development)
- System libraries for Chromium used by Playwright. Install with `sudo uv run playwright install-deps` when first prompted (headless browsing / websearch relies on them).

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory (never commit real secrets). For production, prefer a secure secret management solution (Vault, cloud environment injection, etc.).

| Name | Required | Example | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| JWT_SECRET | Yes | slidev-ai-jwt-secret-key | Symmetric key used to sign/verify JWT. Use a long random value in production. |
| PORT | No | 3001 | Backend service listening port. |
| SLIDEV_MCP_REPO | No | https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/slidev-mcp | MCP (Model Capability Plugin) repository URL. Will be cloned if missing locally at startup. |
| SLIDEV_MCP_PATH | No | slidev-mcp | Local storage path for the MCP repo (relative to project root or absolute). |
| SLIDEV_MCP_UPDATE_INTERVAL | No | 3600000 | Auto update check interval for MCP in milliseconds (example is 1 hour). |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | Yes (when AI features enabled) | sk-xxxxxxxPLACEHOLDER | API key for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Use your own key; do NOT commit it. |
| OPENAI_BASE_URL | Yes | https://api.deepseek.com | Base URL of the OpenAI-compatible API (can point to self-hosted/proxy). |
| OPENAI_MODEL | Yes | deepseek-chat | Default model name; adjust as needed. |
| ADMIN_USER | No (default: admin) | admin | Admin username created at first startup. Change on first deployment. |
| ADMIN_PASSWORD | No (default: admin) | ChangeMe_123! | Plaintext admin password used only at initialization (hashed before storing). Use a strong random value in production. |

Security Notes:
1. Never keep the default `admin / admin` combo in production.
2. After changing `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, you can delete the existing admin row in DB and restart to recreate it.
3. Rotate `JWT_SECRET` carefully (existing tokens become invalid). Plan a rollout if sessions matter.

Example `.env`:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=slidev-ai-jwt-secret-key
PORT=3001
SLIDEV_MCP_REPO=https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/slidev-mcp
SLIDEV_MCP_PATH=slidev-mcp
SLIDEV_MCP_UPDATE_INTERVAL=3600000
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxPLACEHOLDER
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
OPENAI_MODEL=deepseek-chat
ADMIN_USER=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeMe_123!
```

### Quick Installation

Below is a streamlined local setup (frontend + backend + Playwright Chromium). Adjust paths/secrets as needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/slidev-ai.git
cd slidev-ai

# Install workspace deps (root, frontend, backend)
npm install

# Install Python dependencies for slidev-mcp and headless browser (Chromium)
cd backend/slidev-mcp
uv sync
uv run playwright install chromium
# (Optional) system packages if warned
sudo uv run playwright install-deps || true
cd ../../

# Start all (Turbo dev: backend + frontend)
npm run dev
```

When a feature invokes headless browsing (e.g. websearch) for the first time, Playwright will use the cached Chromium at `~/.cache/ms-playwright`. Cache this path in CI to speed up builds.

#### Playwright Notes
- To install all browsers later (Python side): `uv run playwright install`
- Version is pinned via `@playwright/test` in root `package.json`.
- Headless deps can also be installed manually (see warning output) if `install-deps` is not allowed.

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/slidev-ai.git
cd slidev-ai
npm i
# （Python crawler already installed its own Chromium via uv run playwright install）
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
